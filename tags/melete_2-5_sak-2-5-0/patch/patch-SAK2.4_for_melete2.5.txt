Sakai 2.4.x Patch Instructions for Melete 2.5
------------------------------------------------

1.  Go to the sakai-src directory and run the script present in the Melete source code(/patch/melete25patchsak24.sh). 
This script merges the relevant, required changes of the jsf folder.

2. Make sure sakai builds properly after running this script as sometimes svn merge command fails.

	If the script fails or build fails, then the revision numbers are:
	
    	* widgets/src/java/org/sakaiproject/jsf/renderer/InputRichTextRenderer.java r30727
